# Reflection

While building the persona-based system prompts, the biggest learning came from realizing how much the **quality of prompts affects the quality of responses**. Initially, my prompts were very simple and lacked structure. For example, one of my early prompts looked like:

**Early Prompt Example :**
"Write like Abhimanyu Saxena. Be motivational and talk about builders."

This produced responses that sounded generic and overly motivational, but did not feel authentic or grounded in how he actually communicates. The responses lacked depth and sounded similar to any generic tech influencer voice. This made me realize that vague instructions produce vague outputs.

After researching more carefully, I improved the prompts by adding **structured behavioral instructions** and including background context gathered from multiple sources like LinkedIn, podcasts, YouTube videos, and Twitter. I started analyzing patterns in tone, structure, and message themes rather than just copying words.

**Improved Prompt Example :**
"You are simulating Abhimanyu Saxena.
Background: Co-founder of InterviewBit and Scaler.
Communication style: Builder-focused, encouraging curiosity, mission-driven.
Thinking pattern: Observation → Insight → Possibility.
Use calm optimism and emphasize learning through building."

This produced responses that felt significantly more realistic and aligned with how he communicates publicly. The outputs became more consistent, structured, and believable.

One of the most important concepts I learned during this process was the **GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) principle**. When I used lazy prompts with minimal details, the outputs were shallow and generic. However, when I invested time into gathering better inputs—such as reviewing LinkedIn posts, watching YouTube talks, listening to podcasts, and reading social media content—the outputs improved noticeably. The model performed much better when the instructions were specific, detailed, and behavior-focused.

Another improvement that helped was adding **example question–answer pairs** inside the system prompt. This anchored the response style and reduced randomness. Without examples, responses varied too much. With examples, the responses became shorter, clearer, and more consistent.

If I were to improve this work further, I would focus on collecting more **direct writing samples** from each person instead of relying only on summaries or descriptions. I would also try creating **separate prompts for different contexts**, such as technical explanations, leadership advice, and motivational communication, because the same person often communicates differently depending on the situation.

Overall, this exercise helped me understand that prompt writing is not just about wording instructions but about **modeling behavior**, and that good research and structured thinking significantly improve the final output.
